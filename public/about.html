<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
    I am a C# .NET developer with over 20 years of professional experience as a software developer. Currently, I am
    the MIS Director for Commercial Risk Management, where I have worked since August 2005. I helped lead a project 
    to rebuild the custom software application using VB .NET, C# .NET, SQL Server, Team Foundation Server, SQL Server
    Integrated Services, SQL Server Reporting Services, Entity Framework, and Tableau. I currently work on maintaining
    the application by fixing defects and adding new features to the application.

    In my spare time, I have been learning Angular, Node, Express, MongoDB, TypeScript, and Python. In addition, I
    have developed several video games using the Godot game engine. Godot is a free open source engine for developing
    2D and 3D games, and has seen a lot of improvements in the last year. I hope to one day become an indie game
    developer making mobile games and small games for Mac/PC/Linux to release on Steam.

    This page has been built and designed as part of the Full Stack Web Developer bootcamp course on Udemy. The course
    so far has been mostly a review on HTML, but it looks very promising and I hope to pick up new skills in the 
    upcoming sections that are focused on Flexbox, Bootstrap, JavaScript and more.
