<h1>The Best Movies According to Lonnie!</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All Time</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Spirited Away</h3>
<p>Really, any Miyazaki film is great, but Spirted Away is the first one that comes to mind as a truly great anime film.
</p>
<h3>Terminator</h3>
<p>This one made me hide under my seat in the movie theater as a child. A real classic sci-fi movie.</p>
<h3>Deadpool and Wolverine</h3>
<p>This is the last movie I have seen in the theater as of the time I'm writing this. It is probably the best movie I
    have seen in a long time.!</p>
